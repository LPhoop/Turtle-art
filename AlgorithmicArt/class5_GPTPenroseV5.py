# CAC (4/3/23)
# Me:
# Again, you didn't fix either problem.
# Do you really understand how to write python code or are you faking it?
#
# ChatGPT:
# I apologize for the confusion.
# It seems that my previous responses were not helpful.
# I am capable of writing Python code, but I can make mistakes as well.
# I understand that my previous solutions did not meet your expectations.
#
# Here is a corrected version of the code that should correctly draw a
# Penrose tiling using Python turtle:
#
# <The code in this file>
#
# This code should correctly draw the Penrose tiling using Python turtle
# without any overlapping tiles. It sets the depth to 3,
# but you can adjust it to any value to control the level of detail
# in the tiling. The final image is displayed and the turtle graphics
# window will remain open until closed manually.
#
# I hope this version works for you.
#
#
# (At this point I gave up because this one was even worse)
